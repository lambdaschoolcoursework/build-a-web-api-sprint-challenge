## Questions

**Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.**

I learned a ton, but two things are: needing to use express.json() so that Express can handle JSON and creating custom middleware that can be reused in different endpoints.

**Describe Middleware.**

Middleware increases the functionality of Express.

**Describe a Resource.**

A resource refers to the URI that is accessed via HTTP methods such as post, get, put, and delete.

**What can an API return to help clients know if a request was successful?**

The API can return different status codes that mean different things.

**How can we partition our application?**

We can create seperate router files where it makes sense to.
